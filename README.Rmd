# kiaora

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of kiaora is to provide functions to get Auckland transport 
information and residential auction results for NZ property, including 
property information,auction price and dates, rating value and dates.

## Installation

You can install the released version of kiaora from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("kiaora")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Tina-ye112/kiaora")
```
## Usage

This function contains 3 parameters that are region, district, area.You could ...

```{r}
library(kiaora)
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
get_property_auction_price(region = "Northland",district = NULL,area = NULL)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r}
summary(nzhousingprice)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data=subset(nzhousingprice,region=="Auckland"&district=="North Shore City"))+
  geom_line(aes(x=auction_dates,y=auction_price))
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
